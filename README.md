# SwiftNN
An implementation of a feed forward neural network in swift

It was mainly a test to use the Accelerate framework for high efficiency CPU computations. 

It was also a test of the Swish activation function which in the initial tests performs better then ReLU and Sigmoid. 

This repository currently has the code to test a auto encoder that works on mnsit data, with a latent dimension of 10. This performs quite well given the reduction significant reduction in dimensionality.
